## javalib

javalib is a Java Library of Data Structures and Algorithms I have implemented for practice.

### Building

* To compile, type: `mvn compile`
* To run unit tests, type: `mvn test`

### Dependencies

* JUnit

### Data Structures

* Binary Heap
* Graph (undirected & directed)
* Queue
* Thread Pool
* Timer
* Bounded Buffer

### Algorithms:

Arrays:
* quicksort
* binary search
* first occurrence
* kth smallest element
* count inversions
* remove duplicates
* merge sort
* minimum cover
* generate permutations

Graphs:
* shortest path (BFS)
* shortest path (Djikstra)
* shortest path (min cost & length)
* cycle detection
* find articulation vertices
* topological sort (DAG)

Math:
* power
* square root
* binomial coefficient
* enumerate primes

Strings:
* palindrome
* Knuth-Morris-Pratt matching

Trees:
* pre-, in- and post-order traversal (recursive & iterative)
* binary tree symmetry
